## Description

- I made this project in order to help me organize the notes I would take during the bootcamp
- Because it was a nice challenge that in the end helped me build the foundation for the skills needed during the bootcamp
- It solved the problem of how/where I would take my notes for the course
- That Javascript is my weakpoint between it and HTML/CSS


## Installation

To my knowledge all you need for this is a browser to find the wepage once it goes live

## Usage

Once it goes live it can be used as a very mobile study guide that can be pulled up as long as one has connection


## Tests

Head into the console test out function selectTopic() and listTopics()
